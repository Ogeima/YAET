# YAET : Yet another Eberban tutorial

[Eberban](https://eberban.github.io/eberban/) is a unique logical constructed language which is still a Work in Progress.
The reference grammar of Eberban gives a comprehensive overview of the language features, but isn't really *beginner friendly*.
This is why I chose to write this tutorial, both to deepen my own understanding of Eberban sentences and to enable others to start learning the language gently.

This ressource is also a work in progress.
If you find any errors or think something is unclear or would like to suggest something, contact me on the Eberban discord server : [ber supa](https://discord.gg/5PmntaCA).
Also keep in mind that English is not my native language :)
