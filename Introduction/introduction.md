# Introduction

Eberban sentences follow a simple and consistent construction, yet sometimes a bit confusing for beginners.
The apparent simplicity of sentences like “mi buri meon” (I eat an apple) that resemble the English grammar can lead learners to forget the original distinctive characteristics of the Eberban grammar, which are necessary to master in order to express more intricate concepts and ideas.

In this slow-paced tutorial inspired by the [Eberban reference grammar](https://eberban.github.io/eberban/books/refgram/book/index.html), I will do my best to help you understand Eberban sentences and build an intuition for this one-of-a-kind grammar, so that you will then be able to create your own sentences!

Here are the ressources that we will use :
